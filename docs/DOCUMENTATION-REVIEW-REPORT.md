## Gaps Identified

### HIGH PRIORITY (Should address before Phase 1 implementation)

#### 1. Missing Patterns in TECH-STACK.md

| Pattern | Impact | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| **File Upload/Download** | Blocks medical imaging | Add patterns for image/DICOM upload, streaming, progress tracking |
| **Background Jobs** | Blocks PDF generation, email sending | Add job queue patterns (consider Bull/BullMQ) |
| **Soft Delete Queries** | Inconsistent data handling | Add query patterns for including/excluding deleted records |
| **Concurrency Control** | Data conflicts possible | Add optimistic locking patterns with version fields |

#### 2. Missing Patterns in AUTH-PATTERNS.md

| Pattern | Impact | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| **Field-Level Permissions** | HIPAA risk | Add patterns for hiding sensitive fields by role |
| **Resource Ownership** | Patients can't access own data | Add patterns for "can user access THIS specific record" |
| **Multi-Clinic Switching** | UX issue for super_admin | Add patterns for switching clinic context mid-session |
| **Permission Inheritance** | Code duplication | Add role hierarchy patterns (doctor inherits from clinical_staff) |

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Should address before Phase 2)

#### 3. Missing Patterns in STYLING-GUIDE.md

| Pattern | Impact | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Loading States | Inconsistent UX | Add skeleton screens, spinners, progress indicators |
| Empty States | Poor empty list UX | Add empty state component patterns with CTAs |
| Form Validation States | Inconsistent feedback | Add success/warning states, inline vs submission validation |
| Status Badges | Inconsistent status display | Add complete badge color/meaning guide |

#### 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns Not Documented

| Concern | Impact | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| WebSocket Patterns | No real-time features | Add patterns for live updates (appointment changes, notifications) |
| Search/Full-Text | Poor search UX | Add full-text search patterns (MongoDB Atlas Search or local) |
| Event-Driven Architecture | Tight coupling | Add event patterns for audit, notifications, sync |
| Health Checks/Monitoring | Ops blindness | Add health endpoint and logging patterns |

### LOW PRIORITY (Can address during implementation)

#### 5. Template Gaps

| Missing Template | Use Case |
|------------------|----------|
| Database Migration | Schema changes |
| Breaking Changes | API deprecation |
| Performance Optimization | Optimization tracking |
| Integration Test Patterns | Testing guidance |

#### 6. MASTER-INDEX.md Inconsistencies

Some areas show "TBD" for sub-areas/functions when documentation is actually complete:
- Treatment Management: Shows "TBD" but has 24 functions documented
- Practice Orchestration: Shows "TBD" but has 20 functions documented
- Staff Management: Shows "TBD" but has 24 functions documented
- Resources Management: Shows "TBD" but has 23 functions documented
- Vendors Management: Shows "TBD" but has 20 functions documented

**Recommendation**: Update MASTER-INDEX.md to reflect actual documentation state.

   - Image upload with validation
   - DICOM file handling
   - Progress tracking
   - Secure storage patterns

2. **Add Field-Level Permissions to AUTH-PATTERNS.md**
   - Hide PHI fields by role
   - Example with clinical notes

3. **Add Background Job Patterns**

   - Retry strategies
   - Email/PDF generation examples

4. **Add Soft Delete Query Patterns**
   - Query examples with deletedAt
   - Restore functionality

5. **Update MASTER-INDEX.md**
   - Fix "TBD" entries that are actually complete
   - Ensure function counts match reality

### Should Do (Before Phase 2)

6. **Add Loading/Empty State Patterns to STYLING-GUIDE.md**
7. **Add WebSocket Patterns for real-time features**
8. **Add Search Patterns (full-text search)**
9. **Add Resource Ownership Patterns to AUTH-PATTERNS.md**
10. **Add Concurrency Control Patterns**

### Nice to Have (During Implementation)

11. Add database migration template
12. Add performance optimization template
13. Add integration test patterns
14. Add prompt engineering guidelines to AI-INTEGRATION.md
15. Add health check/monitoring patterns

## Summary

The Orca documentation represents an exceptional planning effort:
- **14 areas** fully documented with business context and technical specs
- **340+ function specifications** with API endpoints, data models, and business rules
- **4 comprehensive guides** covering tech stack, styling, auth, and AI
- **Excellent orthodontic domain knowledge** embedded throughout
- **Clear implementation phases** with dependencies mapped

**Implementation is well underway.** The identified documentation gaps are being addressed as implementation progresses. Most "Must Do" items have been resolved through actual implementation patterns.

**Current Focus**: Complete Patient Communications remaining gaps, then address Staff Management incomplete features before moving to Phase 3.
